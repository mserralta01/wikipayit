# Wikipayit Project Wiki

## Project Overview
Wikipayit is a modern web application built with React, TypeScript, and a robust tech stack to provide payment processing solutions. The project leverages cutting-edge technologies for both frontend and backend development.

## Tech Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query)
- **Form Management**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Animation**: Framer Motion and GSAP
- **3D Rendering**: Three.js with React Three Fiber

### Backend & Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: Vercel
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage
- **API**: Next.js API Routes

### Development Tools
- **Bundler**: Vite
- **Linting**: ESLint with TypeScript support
- **Styling**: PostCSS with Tailwind CSS
- **Version Control**: GitHub

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- npm (v9+)
- Firebase CLI

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Building for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

## Key Architectural Patterns

### Component Structure
- Components are organized by feature in `src/components`
- UI components are built using shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS
- Complex state is managed using React Query

### Data Flow
- API calls are handled through React Query hooks
- Forms are managed with React Hook Form and validated with Zod
- Global state is managed through React Context where necessary

### Authentication
- Firebase Authentication handles user authentication
- Protected routes use the `ProtectedRoute` component

## Important Components

### Admin Components
- `AdminLayout`: Main layout for admin pages
- `Pipeline`: Kanban-style pipeline for managing leads
- `MerchantDetails`: Detailed view of merchant information

### Merchant Components
- `MerchantApplicationForm`: Multi-step form for merchant onboarding
- `BankDetailsStep`: Handles bank account information
- `BeneficialOwnerStep`: Captures ownership information

### UI Components
- `Button`, `Card`, `Input`: Core UI elements from shadcn/ui
- `Toast`: Notification system using react-hot-toast
- `DataTable`: Reusable table component with sorting and filtering

## Services

### Firebase Services
- `firebase.ts`: Firebase initialization and configuration
- `authService.ts`: Handles authentication logic
- `firestoreService.ts`: Manages Firestore operations

### API Services
- `emailService.ts`: Handles email sending
- `merchantService.ts`: Manages merchant-related operations
- `storageService.ts`: Handles file uploads to Firebase Storage

## Deployment

### Vercel Deployment
- Automatic deployments from the main branch
- Environment variables configured in Vercel dashboard
- Preview deployments for pull requests

### Firebase Rules
- Firestore and Storage security rules are defined in `firestore.rules` and `storage.rules`
- Rules are deployed using Firebase CLI

## Contributing
1. Create a new branch for your feature/bugfix
2. Follow the existing code style and patterns
3. Write tests for new functionality
4. Open a pull request for review

## Troubleshooting
- Check Firebase rules if experiencing permission issues
- Verify environment variables are properly set
- Use React Query Devtools for debugging API calls
